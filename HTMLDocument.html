<font face="Arial" size="4" color="blue"> <p> HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
<p>HTML is a combination of text, like what you see as you read this article, and items called tags. HTML tags are words or abbreviations surrounded by angle brackets (< and >), as in the image above.

The web browser uses HTML tags to know how to display each item on the web page. If a block of text is surrounded by a tag meant to create paragraphs, the browser understands that that text should appear as a paragraph. The same is true for the page's header area and the body of the web page, both of which also have associated tags.
